## Features
- Vectorized GLA for fast RGB clustering
- Conversion between sRGB, CIE XYZ and CIE Lab colorspaces 
- "Rounding" algorithm using bit manipulation to bucket colors together

## In progress
- LBA algorithm from Yang et al. (2008). A Fast Method for Dominant Color Descriptor with New Similarity Measure [1] <https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.472.2872&rep=rep1&type=pdf>
